# Mechanics

Game screen scrolls vertically with the player at the bottom of the screen. Player can move around the screen on both x and y axis to the full length of  the screen height and width.
Enemies will appear from all angles of the screen except the bottom of the screen. There will be a maximum number of enemies allowed to spawn on the screen at any given time. The player will be able to shoot enemies provided the shoot cooldown timer has reset of the bullet intercepts the enemy width or height the enemy is dead. For each enemy killed the player score will go up by X amount. Once the player reaches position 300 on the Y Axis on the map the levels boss will spawn and all remaining enemies will be removed. The player will shoot bullets at the boss with each bullet that intercepts the boss’s width and height a random number will be generated (1-10) this will be the amount of damage the boss takes. Once all random numbers that have been generated are equal to or more than the boss’s health (100) the boss is dead and the player can progress to the next level. Both enemies and bosses will shoot bullets at the player, if any bullets intercept the player's width or height the player will lose a life.
